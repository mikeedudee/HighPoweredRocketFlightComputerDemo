# High Powered Rocket Flight Computer Demo
This is a sample or demonstration of a working flight computer for a high powered rocket using Arduino DE. Supports multiple microcontrollers. This program has been tested and is considered ready for flight and 100% working. Though I recommend changing some parameters to suit your mission profile and always test if you made changes.

Key parameters to change:
ALT_THRESHOLD_GREEN  = Detection of launch.
ALT_THRESHOLD_RED    = Detection of Apogee (theoretically based on your calculation).
ALT_RESET_THRESHOLD  = Detection of prominent touchdown.
